Put a date and a crypto, optionally a quantity of that crypto, to see how much
has augmented/increased in dollars & percentage

## Figma

I still have a lot to learn about design, but
[here is the prototype](https://figma.com/file/lYFSAii5uvTiSbicomlSKb/crypif).

## Deploy

This uses [CryptoCompare](https://cryptocompare.com) to get the historical data,
[get an API key](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com) and set it as an environment
variable called `API_KEY`.
