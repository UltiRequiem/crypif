Put a date and a crypto, optionally a quantity of that crypto,
it will tell you how much has augmented/increased in dollars and percentage.

## Figma

I still have a lot to learn about design, but [here is the prototype](https://figma.com/file/lYFSAii5uvTiSbicomlSKb/crypif).

## Deploy

This uses [CryptoCompare](https://cryptocompare.com) to get the historical data, [get an API key](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com).

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FUltiRequiem%2Fcrypif%2Ftree%2Fmain)

Now configure a environment variable called `API_KEY` with your API key.
